						Hydrogen-rich electrolyzed reduced water (ERW)
					</span>{" "}
					is a special type of water infused with extra hydrogen gas through a
					process called electrolysis. Scientific research has revealed that the
					real hero behind ERW&apos;s health benefits is the molecular hydrogen
					(H2) it contains. <br />
					<br />
					This tiny, powerful molecule can travel deep into our cells, offering
					antioxidant benefits by neutralizing harmful substances called free
					radicals, reducing inflammation, and protecting our cells from stress.
					<br />
					<br />
					Unlike some of the exaggerated claims you might have heard, the
					benefits of ERW come from this dissolved hydrogen, not from changing
					the water&apos;s structure or its alkalinity. <br />
					<br />
					In simple terms, drinking hydrogen-rich water is like giving your body
					a molecular shield, helping to keep your cells healthy and resilient
					against damage.

					<span className='text-white font-bold'>Hypochlorous Acid (HOCl)</span>{" "}
					is a gentle yet powerful disinfectant that is safe for humans but
					deadly for viruses and bacteria, including the coronavirus. <br />
					<br />
					It&apos;s a substance naturally produced by our own bodies to fight
					infections and kill harmful organisms. <br />
					<br />
					HOCl can be easily made using just water, salt, and a little
					electricity, making it an affordable and eco-friendly option for
					keeping spaces clean and safe. <br />
					<br />
					It works quickly to disinfect surfaces and can even be used in foggers
					to sanitize large areas without leaving toxic residues. <br />
					<br />
					Whether you&apos;re cleaning a medical office or your home, HOCl
					offers an effective way to protect against germs and viruses without
					harming people or the environment.
